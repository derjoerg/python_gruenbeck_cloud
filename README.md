This is my first try to get access to the Gruenbeck-Cloud-API (water softeners) through an asynchronous Python library. Final plan is to build an home-assistant integration on top of this library.

This is deprecated. Please use the perfect working library from [p0l0](https://github.com/p0l0/pygruenbeck_cloud)
